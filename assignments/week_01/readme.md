# Introduction

This will be your first assignment of this type, so let's provide an introduction to the process first. We'll begin by setting up the tools you will need.


## Step 1: Install Python

If you already have python installed, please verify this by running `python --version` from the command line. If you don't yet know how to run something from the command line, that's okay, you should continue on with this step. If have have python version 3.6.* or higher, you may skip to the next step.


We'll install python using Anaconda. Go to https://www.anaconda.com/download/ and download the installer for the latest version of python.

## Step 2: Using the command line

This class will not provide a thorough command line tutorial. I recommend searching around for one if that is important to you.

Throughout this class, unless stated otherwise, when we ask you to run a command, what we mean is that you should copy the text of the command into your command line and hit enter to execute. This means something slightly different for each operating system:

- MacOS: Terminal is the built in command line tool and there are several third-party ones.
- Linux/\*nix: typically the default command line tool is called Terminal.
- Windows: you will use the Anaconda Prompt that we installed in step 1.

Now, you should be able to check your python version in the command line with `python --version`. This should confirm that you are using python version 3.6 or higher.


## Step 2: Install packages
