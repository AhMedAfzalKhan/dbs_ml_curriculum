    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def clean_person_name(name):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Cleans the user name and returns it back\n",

    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    name = clean_person_name(row[0])\n",
    "    product_name = lookup_product_name_from_id(row[1])\n",
    "    converted_price = convert_pounds_to_dollars(row[2])\n",
    "    return (name, product_name, converted_price)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, process_row only really accomplishes one task - processing each row. However, it needed some help in cleaning the persons name, so we outsourced that to the other function of `clean_person_name` which only has one job - cleaning the person's name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those functions allow us to perform repeated actions efficiently, with minimal code. They also give us a few other benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If we need to upgrade our process, we just have to change the function in one place and it will propagate to the rest of the code.\n",
    "* When we get errors, Python tracks what function broke and where, so we'll be able to quickly track down errors.\n",
    "* If we're clever with args and kwargs, we should be able to build very flexible solutions to many problems.\n",
