title: Curse Of Dimensionality
---

# Objectives

Student's should be able to
* Recognize situations where the Curse of Dimensionality is likely to cause problems.
* Explain how the Curse of Dimensionality works, both at a high level, and precisely with either math or code.

# Revision notes

Things changed from beta:
* Added a classifiation example in the notebook to show how model accuracy degrades when we just add dimensions
* Added a PowerPoint with illustrations of fitting a classification model in 1D, 2D, and then 3D, then showing how the 3D could be over-fitting when collpased back to 2D

# Sample Lesson

1. [Curse of dimensionality deck (15 min)](https://github.com/thisismetis/dscurriculum_gamma/blob/master/curriculum/project-04/curse-of-dimensionality/curse_of_dim_lecture.pdf)
2. [Curse of dimensionality notebook (15 min)](https://github.com/thisismetis/dscurriculum_gamma/blob/master/curriculum/project-04/curse-of-dimensionality/Curse_of_Dimensionality.ipynb)

# Instructor Notes

This should be a fairly straightforward lesson. Most students should be able to get an intuitive understanding. Repeat that this issue is what the next lecture (SVD/PCA, etc) tries to fix for.
