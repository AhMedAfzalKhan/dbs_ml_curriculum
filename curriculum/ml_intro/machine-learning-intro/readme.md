# Sample Lesson Plan

- (40 m) [Intro to Machine Learning](Intro-to-ML.pptx)

# Learning Objectives

Students can
* Discuss differences and overlap between Machine Learning and Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.
* Explain what we mean by "learning" in machine learning.
* Explain the parts of the ML framework
    * Apply new models to the machine learning framework.
* Understand the two common goals of ML: prediction and interpretability.

# Depends On

None but likely best to follow [Linear Regression](https://github.com/thisismetis/dscurriculum_gamma/tree/master/curriculum/project-02/linear-regression-theory-intro) so students have a concrete foundational example for these concepts.

# Instructor Notes

If time permits, this is a lesson that is fun to do with a lot of class interaction. We're mostly doing two things: 1) defining some terms and 2) giving examples of Machine Learning models. Discussion of what these terms mean is often more effective if students can contrast these definitions with their intuitive understanding.
