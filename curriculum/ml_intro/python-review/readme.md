# Sample Lesson

- (65m) [Python Style and Datatype Review](python_review_and_best_practices.ipynb)
- (10m) [Importing with Python Example](importing_with_python/importing_example.ipynb)

# Learning Objectives

With the Python Review and Best Practices notebook, students should be able to:

* Know when to use tuples vs lists vs sets vs dictionaries
* Understand at a high level the concept of immutability
* Have an understanding of how each data type is converted to a boolean, and
how to check each type for existence
* Know how to loop through data, including using enumerate
* How to write functions and document code effectively
* How to handle errors using try-except or raise

After the Importing with Python section, the students should know how to:

* Import a module
* Use `from x import y`
* Understand the basics of namespaces

## Python Review and Best Practices

The goal of this notebook is to walk students through all of the common data
types in Python, as well as a few "extra" ones - then to spend time talking
about best practices such as using truthiness, list comprehensions,
generators, etc. All of the notebook is notated throughout to act as a
reference for students. There are several points with questions to ask the students
before running a cell. There are also 2 exercises embedded in the lecture.

## Importing with Python

This notebook demonstrates some of the subtle aspects of importing modules in
Python and demonstrates how to use your own modules. This is meant to act as
a reference and is heavily annotated.
