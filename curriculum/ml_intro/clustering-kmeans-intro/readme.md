title: Clustering K-means Intro
---

# Sample Lesson

- (40m) [Introduction to Clustering](Unsupervised_Learning_KMeans.pptx)

# Revision Notes

This lesson is meant to be a theoretical introduction to
- unsupervised learning
- clustering
- k-means

Students should also have an idea of how they could use clustering in their project 4.

# Objectives

Students can
* Outline an unsupervised project that uses clustering to group related observations.
* Explain measures of clustering performance (inertia and silhouette coefficient)
  * Explain how these measures can be used to choose `k`, the number of clusters.
* Whiteboard the k-means algorithm.


# Instructor notes

For k-means, this lesson focuses on the theory and uses a toy example to illustrate key concepts. The accompanying [lab](https://github.com/thisismetis/dscurriculum_gamma/tree/master/curriculum/project-04/clustering-means-lab/KMeansClustering.ipynb) offers hands-on experience with k-means using more realistic data.
