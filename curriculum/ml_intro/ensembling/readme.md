# Sample Lesson Plan
- (75m) [Ensembling](Ensemble_Methods.ipynb)

# Learning Objectives

Students can
* Understand and explain key concepts of ensembling models.
  * Different methods
    * Averaging, Bagging, and other sampling based methods.
    * Boosting
    * Stacking
  * How ensembling affects over/underfitting.  
* Apply Random Forest methods to a supervised project.
  * Explain and tune hyperparameters.
  * Respond to over or underfitting.
* Use meta-estimators to apply ensembling to other models.

# Depends On

[Classification and Regression Trees](https://github.com/thisismetis/dscurriculum_gamma/tree/master/curriculum/project-03/classification-and-regression-trees)

Ensemble model uses: [Linear Model](https://github.com/thisismetis/dscurriculum_gamma/tree/master/curriculum/project-02/linear-regression-code-intro), [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/thisismetis/dscurriculum_gamma/tree/master/curriculum/project-03/naive-bayes), [KNN](https://github.com/thisismetis/dscurriculum_gamma/tree/master/curriculum/project-03/knn-classification-intro), [SVC](https://github.com/thisismetis/dscurriculum_gamma/tree/master/curriculum/project-03/svm), [Random Forest](https://github.com/thisismetis/dscurriculum_gamma/tree/master/curriculum/project-03/classification-and-regression-trees), Extra Trees, AdaBoost
