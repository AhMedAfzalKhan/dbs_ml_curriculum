# Sample Lesson

- (20m) [Model Complexity Notebook](Classification_Model_Complexity.ipynb)

# Objectives

Students will be able to

- Apply theoretical concepts of complexity to real models with nontrivial datasets.
- Benchmark models for big-o using wall clock.
- Critically assess models in terms of runtime.

# Instructor notes

This is a very short lesson that asks students to apply the concepts of big-O complexity learned earlier in [complexity](/curriculum/project-1/complexity). Most of the code is written out, so it can be treated like a demo with only check for understanding questions. Alternatively, there is an optional exercise at the end to run the analysis using different sizes of features.
