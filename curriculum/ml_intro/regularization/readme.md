# Sample Lesson Plan

- (60m) [Regularization Presentation](Regularization.pptx)
- (30-45m) [Regularization Code](regularization_code.ipynb)

# Learning Objectives

Students can:

* Understand the bias-variance tradeoff and its relationship with over/underfitting
* Learn how regularization can reduce overfitting by punishing model complexity and build intuition for how it works
* Work through an applied example of regularization, reviewing key practical considerations like validation workflows

# Depends On

[Linear Regression Code Intro](https://github.com/thisismetis/dscurriculum_gamma/tree/master/curriculum/project-02/linear-regression-code-intro)

[Cross Validation](https://github.com/thisismetis/dscurriculum_gamma/tree/master/curriculum/project-02/cross-validation)

# Instructor Notes

A general introduction to the bias-variance tradeoff is a core part of this lesson. Also, the coding example walkthrough should emphasize how it shows an example/review of the standard validation and CV workflows that are covered in the cross validation lecture.

# Additional Resources

See [additional resources folder](https://github.com/thisismetis/dscurriculum_gamma/tree/master/curriculum/project-02/regularization/additional_resources) for past materials and ElasticNet coding example.
