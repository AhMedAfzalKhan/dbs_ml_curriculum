# A few words about this class

Data Science is a child of many academic and professional disciplines. It might borrow most from Software Engineering.

The most important role of a Data Scientist and Data Analyst is to *translate*
  - between the various disciplines we use operate on data
  - and to translate from those disciplines to "lay" listeners, such as those focused business applications.

## Software engineering

In this class, we will be taking a software engineering approach. You aren't expected to fully become a software engineer, but, over this course, you will be exposed to, and asked to master, a software engineering approach to data.

Like many fields, software engineering has developed a reputation for machismo that sometimes deters newcomers.

We'll take this slow and we'll adapt as needed to make sure everyone who puts in the time has everything they need to succeed.

# Assignments and class work

You will expected to be present for all lectures and labs.

An assignment will be released each week and will be due the following week before class begins.

You can find assignments in the [assignments](/assignments) folder of this repository.

Each assignment will contain a field for your name and collaborators. Unless stated otherwise, it is acceptable and even encouraged to work with others in the course so long as you follow these expectations:
- **All submitted work must be your own.** Code will be checked for copying. Of course, some parts of code are trivial (there are only so many ways to check `len(my_list) == 5`) but substantially copied submissions will be caught.
- **List all collaborators** in the submitted homework.

## Submissions

Submissions should be sent in a direct message to Sophie Searcy and Mikhail on the [class slack](https://dbs-ml.slack.com)
