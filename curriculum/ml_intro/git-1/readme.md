# Instructor Notes

This lesson will introduce the ideas of version control via the git interface,
as well as teaching students how to make their own repositories.
The lecture starts by introducing the need for version control, then moves
into how commits work, what the 3 stages of `git` are, and how to use `git
log` to see the history of a repository.

In the middle of the lecture, there is an exercise to have the students create
their first repository. The code is shown in detail, in the slides, but you
should also follow along so you can show them how to connect to GitHub later.

After creating a repository and doing a few commits (first as a group, then
one on their own), there is an example of reverting to a previous commit.
Discuss the difference between a hard and soft reset in `git`.

The lecture then resumes by introducing the idea of a remote repository and
has the students work with you to setup their first remote repository. You
should show them how to create a repo on GitHub and where to get the
appropriate links. Since GitHub often changes its interface, I have not put images
of those in the lecture so it can be adapted to GUI changes.

Emphasize that a smart student would already be keeping repositories of their
work to make sure they can always get back to a working version and their
system is robust to spilling coffee on their computer.
